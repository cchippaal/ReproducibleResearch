Used knit2html() instead of the Knit HTML button after the first commits.
Reason: I did not generate any \figure subdirectory using the button.
The Chrome html file includes all figures.

Using the knit2html() function the figures can be looked at directly from GitHub in the subdirectory.

Also the .md Markdown file is now generated.
